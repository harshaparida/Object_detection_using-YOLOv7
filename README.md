# Object Detection using YOLOv7 🐱🐶🐰

This project demonstrates the implementation of object detection using YOLOv7, showcasing the detection of three classes: cat, dog, and rabbit. This serves as an introductory project to highlight proficiency in utilizing YOLOv7 for object detection tasks.

## Introduction 🚀

Object detection is a computer vision task that involves identifying and locating objects within an image or video. YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a popular deep learning algorithm used for real-time object detection. YOLOv7 is an iteration of the YOLO algorithm that provides improved performance and accuracy.

In this project, we focus on detecting three classes of animals: cats, dogs, and rabbits. The YOLOv7 model is trained on a dataset containing images annotated with bounding boxes around these classes.

## Dependencies 🛠️

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## Usage 📝

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Object-Detection-YOLOv7.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download Pre-trained Weights:**
   Download the pre-trained YOLOv7 weights from the official repository or provide your own trained weights.

4. **Training and Testing:**
   For training your own YOLOv7 model and testing it on your images, refer to the [YOLOv7 GitHub repository](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7) for detailed instructions.

## Dataset 📂

The dataset used for training the YOLOv7 model consists of images containing annotated bounding boxes around the classes of interest: cat, dog, and rabbit. Ensure proper data preprocessing and annotation before training the model.
